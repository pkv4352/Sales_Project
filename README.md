1. Here I got 12 individual files about each month sales(Same coulumns for all).
2. Grouped all the files data into a single file, so that it would be easy to work on.
3. Made some cleaning on data such removing null, unnecessary rows and extracted.
4. Made few transformations on data columns such as extracting month, state name from order date and address.
5. With the new transformed data, answered few questions such as 
6.      i)Which month has more sales?
7.     ii)Which city has more orders?
8.    iii) Which is the best time to advertise to maximize the product purchase?  
9.     iv)What Product sold the most and why?
10.     v) Monthly increase/Decrease in sales Percentage compared to the previous month.
11.Plotted few barplots and piechart to answer them.
